# ngrok-webhook-ip

i made this tool to send your ngrok ip and port to a discord webhook for when youre hosting a minecraft server.
to use it just install python https://www.python.org/downloads/ and install it, then open up cmd and do "pip install requests".
now just double click send.py and it send it (make sure that you replaced your webhook)

thats it please leave a star
